Easily set up professional events! Integrate registration & ticketing with WP, list all your events, enjoy our free entry management app, and more

== Description ==
Evenium's plugin is tailored for professionals who seek a simple way to register and invite guests to their events directly from their websites. 

Whether your website is built for single or multiple events, Evenium is the tool you need to spend less time managing your event, so you can focus more on helping your participants be more engaged and active.

In five minutes’ time, you’ll create your event, specify ticket types, build custom registration forms, and craft your agenda. Once you're done, you can quickly send invitation emails to your guests, bringing them to your Wordpress website where they will register and get their badges.

Our free entry management app, Evenium OnSite, will help you welcome your guests. You can check them in by searching for their names, or — even better — by scanning their QR codes.

Additionally, your participants will benefit from the free version of our powerful mobile app, Evenium ConnexMe. They will access all the information about your event in the palm of their hands, eliminating the need and cost for paper guidebooks and agendas. Your participants will also have a truly unique way to network and share with other attendees, as it is part of the core strength of our ConnexMe app.

Evenium is a comprehensive solution for managing professional events from your Wordpress website. Find out more by watching the video below or visiting our website www.evenium.net
